Using Array Index


a = "aufwiedersehen"

print(a[1])      # output = u
print(a[0:8])    # output = aufwiede --- the value in index 8 no will not print it will print upto index 7
print(a[1:8:2])  # output = uwee  

#  Start : stop : steps

print(a[-1])     # output = n ---- It will print the last value i.e n 
print(a[::-1])   # output = nehesredeiwfua
''' It will print all the number from last as we have kept empty in start and stop which works as a default
and -1 in steps part which will print the values from last'''
