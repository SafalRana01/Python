# Tuple use small bracket() while list(Array) use big brackets[]


tp = (12, 34, 56, 78, 86, 84, 3)
print(tp)     # output = will display all number
print(tp[0])    # output = 12 
print(tp[0:4])   #output = 12, 34, 56, 78

# IN TUPLE WE CANNOT ASSIGNED OR CHANGE THE NUMBER INSIDE THE BRACKETS FOR EXAMPLE
tp[3] = 99  #Output = error 

# Here tuple is used while if the value is constant and will not be change and listed is used to change 
# the value later also
